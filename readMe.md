# Python Mega Bundle Files

This repo is my collection of code and applications from the StackSkills Python Mega Bundle course

1.  First up is an interactive command line dictionary from a json file loaded directly to the programme at runtime
2.  The second application in this repo is a basic Folium map of Volcanoes in the the USA. This is read in from the text file of comma separated values and published as a web map as test.html
